Greetings

To build the Alice & Bob SSE Chat, we didn't just write HTML; we assembled a kit.

1. Cards contained the chaos.
2. Avatars and Badges gave the actors personality and state.
3. Chat Bubbles handled the complex geometry of conversation.
4. Joins cleaned up our control interfaces.
5. Loading Dots simulated the passage of time and network latency.
By using DaisyUI, we reduced the CSS codebase by roughly 88%, allowing us to focus entirely on the JavaScript logic handling the Server-Sent Events.
